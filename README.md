Hi, I’m @broadel14
I’m interested in Vector illustration, music, photography and videography.
I have 2 YouTube channels, you can watch and SUBSCRIBE if you like it (BroAdel) & (Ranged Rango)
I also made a music (some instrumental track that you can use the track for your content), listen it on : https://songwhip.com/broadel


I make this github just want to put my team project (cancelled project due to some reason).
